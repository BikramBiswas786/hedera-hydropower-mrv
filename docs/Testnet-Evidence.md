# Testnet Evidence – Hydropower MRV Service

This document summarizes key Hedera Testnet transactions generated by the `code/mrv-service` hydropower MRV microservice and shows how they are recorded in `evidence/txids.csv` for independent verification.  

All transaction IDs mentioned here are stored in `evidence/txids.csv` together with device identifiers, nonces, message hashes, and the Hedera Consensus Service topic ID (`0.0.7462776`).  

## 1. MRV telemetry anchors (device TURBINE-1)

Telemetry for `TURBINE-1` was submitted to the MRV service using `POST /telemetry`, which validated the payload, enforced nonce ordering, and anchored a SHA-256 hash of each accepted message to topic `0.0.7462776` on Hedera Testnet (operator account `0.0.6255927`).  

The following table lists representative telemetry events and their corresponding HCS transactions:

| timestamp            | deviceId   | mwh | nonce | txid                                   | topicId    | HashScan URL                                                                 |
|----------------------|-----------|-----|-------|----------------------------------------|------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 2026-02-13T03:55:00Z | TURBINE-1 | 10  | 1     | 0.0.6255927@1770935078.534072862       | 0.0.7462776| https://hashscan.io/testnet/transaction/1770935078.534072862                |
| 2026-02-13T04:00:00Z | TURBINE-1 | 12  | 2     | 0.0.6255927@1770935190.484772101       | 0.0.7462776| https://hashscan.io/testnet/transaction/1770935190.484772101                |
| 2026-02-13T04:25:00Z | TURBINE-1 | 5   | 3     | 0.0.6255927@1770936864.897100834       | 0.0.7462776| https://hashscan.io/testnet/transaction/1770936864.897100834                |

Each transaction on HashScan shows a consensus message containing the SHA-256 hash of the telemetry JSON payload, which allows auditors to verify that off-chain telemetry logs match what was anchored on-chain.  

These same rows appear in `evidence/txids.csv` with the associated `messageHashHex` values returned by the MRV service.  

## 2. MRV snapshot example – TURBINE-1

The MRV service was called with:

- `POST /telemetry` for deviceId `TURBINE-1`, `mwh` `10`, `nonce` `1`.  
- `GET /mrv-snapshot/TURBINE-1` to compute ACM0002 baseline and emission reductions.

Example snapshot response:

```json
{
  "deviceId": "TURBINE-1",
  "electricityMWh": 10,
  "gridEmissionFactor": 0.8,
  "baselineEmissions_tCO2": 8,
  "emissionReductions_tCO2": 8
}
