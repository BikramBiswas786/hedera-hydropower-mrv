\# Testnet Evidence – Hydropower MRV Service



This document summarizes key Hedera Testnet transactions generated by the `code/mrv-service` hydropower MRV microservice and shows how they are recorded in `evidence/txids.csv` for independent verification.\[file:451]



All transaction IDs mentioned here are stored in `evidence/txids.csv` together with device identifiers, nonces, message hashes, and the Hedera Consensus Service topic ID (`0.0.7462776`).\[file:451]



\## 1. MRV telemetry anchors (device TURBINE-1)



Telemetry for `TURBINE-1` was submitted to the MRV service using `POST /telemetry`, which validated the payload, enforced nonce ordering, and anchored a SHA-256 hash of each accepted message to topic `0.0.7462776` on Hedera Testnet (operator account `0.0.6255927`).\[file:451]



The following table lists three representative telemetry events and their corresponding HCS transactions:



| timestamp              | deviceId   | mwh | nonce | txid                                      | topicId    | HashScan URL                                                                 |

|------------------------|-----------|-----|-------|-------------------------------------------|------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

| 2026-02-13T03:55:00Z   | TURBINE-1 | 10  | 1     | 0.0.6255927@1770935078.534072862          | 0.0.7462776| https://hashscan.io/testnet/transaction/1770935078.534072862                |

| 2026-02-13T04:00:00Z   | TURBINE-1 | 12  | 2     | 0.0.6255927@1770935190.484772101          | 0.0.7462776| https://hashscan.io/testnet/transaction/1770935190.484772101                |

| 2026-02-13T04:25:00Z   | TURBINE-1 | 5   | 3     | 0.0.6255927@1770936864.897100834          | 0.0.7462776| https://hashscan.io/testnet/transaction/1770936864.897100834                |



Each transaction on HashScan shows a consensus message containing the SHA-256 hash of the telemetry JSON payload, which allows auditors to verify that off-chain telemetry logs match what was anchored on-chain.\[file:451]\[web:523]



These same rows appear in `evidence/txids.csv` with the associated `messageHashHex` values returned by the MRV service.\[file:451]



\## 2. MRV snapshot example



After the above telemetry events for `TURBINE-1`, the MRV snapshot endpoint was queried:



\- Endpoint: `GET /mrv-snapshot/TURBINE-1`

\- Network: Hedera Testnet (`network: "testnet"`).\[file:451]



The response was:



```json

{"deviceId":"TURBINE-1","electricityMWh":5,"gridEmissionFactor":0.8,"baselineEmissions\_tCO2":4,"emissionReductions\_tCO2":4}

This snapshot demonstrates:



The service computes baseline emissions

Because the MRV service stores state in memory, the electricityMWh value represents the total MWh seen in the current process, not a cumulative on-chain value. The telemetry anchors above, however, remain permanently verifiable via their HashScan records.\[file:451]



3\. Relation to earlier evidence

Earlier phases of this project produced additional Testnet evidence, such as DID creation and token operations, documented in the legacy evidence package and Guardian policy artifacts.\[file:451]



The MRV telemetry anchors and snapshot example in this document extend that evidence by:



Showing a concrete ACM0002-style MRV computation path from raw telemetry to baseline and emission reductions.



Demonstrating nonce-based replay protection on telemetry.



Providing a clear, queryable HCS trail that can be cross-checked in evidence/txids.csv and on HashScan.
