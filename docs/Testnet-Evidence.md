# Testnet Evidence – Hydropower MRV Service

This document summarizes key Hedera Testnet transactions generated by the `code/mrv-service` hydropower MRV microservice and shows how they are recorded in `evidence/txids.csv` for independent verification.

All transaction IDs mentioned here are stored in `evidence/txids.csv` together with device identifiers, nonces, message hashes, and the Hedera Consensus Service topic ID (`0.0.7462776`).

## 1. MRV telemetry anchors (device TURBINE-1)

Telemetry for `TURBINE-1` was submitted to the MRV service using `POST /telemetry`, which validated the payload, enforced nonce ordering, and anchored a SHA-256 hash of each accepted message to topic `0.0.7462776` on Hedera Testnet (operator account `0.0.6255927`).

The following table lists three representative telemetry events and their corresponding HCS transactions:

| timestamp              | deviceId   | mwh | nonce | txid                                      | topicId    | HashScan URL                                                                 |
|------------------------|-----------|-----|-------|-------------------------------------------|------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 2026-02-13T03:55:00Z   | TURBINE-1 | 10  | 1     | 0.0.6255927@1770935078.534072862          | 0.0.7462776| https://hashscan.io/testnet/transaction/1770935078.534072862                |
| 2026-02-13T04:00:00Z   | TURBINE-1 | 12  | 2     | 0.0.6255927@1770935190.484772101          | 0.0.7462776| https://hashscan.io/testnet/transaction/1770935190.484772101                |
| 2026-02-13T04:25:00Z   | TURBINE-1 | 5   | 3     | 0.0.6255927@1770936864.897100834          | 0.0.7462776| https://hashscan.io/testnet/transaction/1770936864.897100834                |

Each transaction on HashScan shows a consensus message containing the SHA-256 hash of the telemetry JSON payload, which allows auditors to verify that off-chain telemetry logs match what was anchored on-chain.

These same rows appear in `evidence/txids.csv` with the associated `messageHashHex` values returned by the MRV service.

## 2. MRV snapshot example

After the above telemetry events for `TURBINE-1`, the MRV snapshot endpoint was queried:

- Endpoint: `GET /mrv-snapshot/TURBINE-1`
- Network: Hedera Testnet (`network: "testnet"`)

The response was:

```json
{
  "deviceId": "TURBINE-1",
  "electricityMWh": 5,
  "gridEmissionFactor": 0.8,
  "baselineEmissions_tCO2": 4,
  "emissionReductions_tCO2": 4
}
This snapshot demonstrates that the service computes baseline emissions as net electricity supplied to the grid (MWh) multiplied by the configured grid emission factor, following ACM0002-style logic. For this PoC, project emissions and leakage emissions are set to zero, so emission reductions equal baseline emissions.

Because the MRV service stores state in memory, the electricityMWh value represents the total MWh seen in the current process, not a cumulative on-chain value. The telemetry anchors above, however, remain permanently verifiable via their HashScan records.

3. Additional MRV event types in evidence/txids.csv
Beyond the POST /telemetry anchors shown above, evidence/txids.csv also captures a broader set of MRV-related events from earlier project phases:

Project and device registration events – transactions that create or update project and device records in Guardian, binding meter or gateway identifiers to DID-style references so they can be tracked consistently across runs.

Telemetry and data-ingestion events – transactions that prove hydropower generation data (simulated or real) was pushed into the MRV pipeline with timestamps and device IDs, demonstrating that data actually flowed through the system.

Baseline and emission calculation events – transactions representing ACM0002-style baseline and emission reduction calculations executed by the policy or tooling, so reviewers can see that calculations were run on-chain instead of assumed off-chain.

Verification and audit-trail events – transactions that anchor MRV events and state transitions on Hedera, creating a time-stamped trail that allows an independent reviewer to reconstruct the MRV lifecycle directly from the ledger.

Any transaction ID from evidence/txids.csv can be opened in a public Hedera explorer such as HashScan, allowing Verra or a VVB to confirm that it exists on the testnet and inspect its metadata.

4. Repository and commit history as living evidence
The hedera-hydropower-mrv repository treats evidence/txids.csv as a living evidence file that is updated as new MRV flows are executed.

For example, commits such as:

5c29c28a68b76af5777c604a306ee422e7b03bde – “Update txids.csv with new data entries and statistics”

show how new transaction IDs and summary statistics are appended over time, rather than freezing the evidence at a single test run. Each such commit both updates the CSV contents and records a Git history hash, giving reviewers a second, code-level trail of when and how evidence was added.

This dual evidence model (on-chain txids plus Git commits) makes it easier for Verra and VVBs to track the evolution of the PoC and to reproduce or extend specific experiments if needed.

5. Relation to earlier testnet artifacts
Earlier phases of this project produced additional Hedera Testnet artifacts that are still referenced from the evidence folder and the Testnet Evidence Package, including:

DID creation and token-operation transactions that demonstrate identity binding and credit/token lifecycle events for hydropower projects.

Guardian policy runs that move data through a full ACM0002-style workflow, from telemetry ingestion to calculation and issuance-related events, with corresponding txids in evidence/txids.csv.

Screenshots, dashboard exports, and a demonstration video that show the system working end to end on testnet, including policy state transitions and MRV calculations.

The MRV telemetry anchors and snapshot example in this document extend that earlier evidence by:

Showing a concrete MRV computation path from raw telemetry to baseline and emission reductions for a named device (TURBINE-1).

Demonstrating nonce-based replay protection and per-message hashing for telemetry submitted via the code/mrv-service microservice.

Providing a clear, queryable HCS trail that can be cross-checked in evidence/txids.csv and on public explorers like HashScan.

Taken together with the VCS Methodology Idea Note and the ACM0002 Alignment Matrix, this evidence shows not only that the ACM0002 logic is implemented correctly, but that it has already been exercised on Hedera Testnet in a way that external reviewers can independently verify.
