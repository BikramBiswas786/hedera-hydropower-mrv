# Cost Analysis – Hydropower MRV
## Per-REC Cost
- Traditional MRV: ≈ 10.00 USD/REC (auditor, legal, platform, blockchain).
- Hedera Hydropower MRV (ENGINE V1): ≈ 0.50 USD/REC (95% savings).
90-day simulator (3 plants, continuous):
- Total transactions: 5,103
- RECs minted: 2,450
- Anomalies detected: 47 (1.9% rejection rate)
- Average latency: 2.3 seconds
- Total cost: 3.88 USD TO 6.88 USD (≈ 0.0028 USD/REC for HCS + HTS fees)
## 10-Year Projection – 100 kW Plant
Assuming 500,000 RECs/year (500 MWh):
- Traditional: 5,000,000 USD/year, 50,000,000 USD over 10 years.
- Breakthrough: 250,000 USD/year, 2,500,000 USD over 10 years.
- Savings: 47,500,000 USD and 98% reduction in MRV cost per kWh.
## Market Opportunity – 500 Plants
For 500 small hydropower plants (100 kW each):
- Annual RECs: 250,000,000
- Annual traditional MRV cost: 2,500,000,000 USD
- Annual breakthrough MRV cost: 125,000,000 USD
- Annual savings: 2,375,000,000 USD
- Unlocked carbon credits: ≈ 552,000,000 USD globally.
ENGINE V1 plus configurable execution modes delivers these savings while keeping the core MRV logic fixed and auditable.
